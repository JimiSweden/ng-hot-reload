  This message is from the main.html; 
   holding all components displayed and loaded as a directive in home.view.html
  
  NOTE:
  All updates (here in main.html) will refresh the content in this page
  This will cause all components loaded in this page to lose state
  - i.e. directives nested in a directive will lose its state unless state is kept in the controller

  Also: 
  It seems like the directive need to have a controller for the hot-reload to work.
